                  <h2>Why Choosing the Right Team for Bathroom Renovation Services Matters</h2>
                  <p>
                      Finding the right team to handle your bathroom renovation services is one of the most important decisions you’ll make as a homeowner. The work affects daily routines, property value, and your sense of comfort. A poorly executed remodel can lead to years of frustration and costly repairs. That’s why our team at Banning Construction Inc. places such a strong emphasis on proper planning, transparent communication, and detailed craftsmanship.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      We’ve worked on projects of all sizes—from compact bathrooms in townhomes to spacious master baths in custom builds. In every case, we bring the same level of professionalism and care. Over the years, our clients have come to recognize our ability to anticipate challenges and recommend durable, cost-conscious solutions that match their vision.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Our Step-by-Step Approach to Bathroom Renovation</h2>
                  <p>
                    We don’t believe in cookie-cutter solutions. Every bathroom we work on reflects the personality and needs of the family using it. To achieve that, our process is built on clarity, collaboration, and precision.
                  </p>
                  <h4>1. Initial Consultation</h4>
                  <p>
                    We begin by sitting down with our clients to understand their goals, needs, and budget. This is a time for open dialogue. Whether you're looking to improve storage, install a walk-in shower, or update fixtures and finishes, we listen closely and offer realistic input.
                  </p>
                  <h4>2. Planning and Design</h4>
                  <p>
                    Once we have a clear understanding of your preferences, we work with trusted designers and suppliers to develop a detailed plan. We walk our clients through material options, layouts, and timeline expectations. During this phase, we offer recommendations based on our years of experience—what works well, what wears best, and what design trends are worth pursuing.
                  </p>
                  <h4>3. Demolition and Prep Work</h4>
                  <p>
                    Once plans are finalized, we prepare the site and begin the demolition work. Our team is careful to protect other parts of your home and keep the area as tidy as possible. We’re fully licensed and insured, and we adhere to all relevant codes and safety practices.
                  </p>
                  <h4>4. Construction and Installation</h4>
                  <p>
                    Here’s where the magic happens. We handle framing, plumbing, electrical, drywall, tile, cabinetry, and fixture installation with steady precision. We use high-quality materials, and our team of tradespeople is skilled in their craft. We make sure everything is aligned, level, and functional—because that’s what you should expect from true professionals.
                  </p>
                  <h4>5. Final Walkthrough and Follow-Up</h4>
                  <p>
                    When the work is complete, we conduct a thorough walkthrough with our clients. We want to make sure everything meets your expectations and functions the way it should. If adjustments are needed, we take care of them quickly. Our work isn’t done until you’re happy.
                  </p>

                        Here are a few common questions we hear from homeowners considering bathroom renovation:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>How long does a typical bathroom renovation take?</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The timeline depends on the scope of the project, but most full renovations take between two to four weeks. We’ll give you a realistic schedule upfront and keep you updated throughout the process.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Can we stay in our home during the renovation?</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In most cases, yes. We work efficiently and take steps to minimize disruption. If multiple bathrooms are available, most families can comfortably stay at home during the project.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Do you provide the materials?</b></li>
